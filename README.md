### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/thenameiswiiwin/template-next13-tailwind.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
yarn
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell
.
├── README.md                       # README file
├── .husky                          # Husky configuration

└── tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript configuration
```

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
yarn commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
yarn build
yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
